# The Game Rule

You can choose an old language (before Java) or one for JVM.

## The Program

1. read the file named `source`
2. sort readed numbers
3. compute the occurrences for each number
4. print all the occurrences

## How to contribute

Here you con find some guidelines on how to contribute with an implementation in your favourite old-but-gold language:

* create a new directory in the repo with the name of the language you want to contribute with and place there the source code of your contribution
* in the code it's recommended to use two different variables to hold the results of the  processing of the different stages:
  * _ordered_: whenever it's possible it may be a list of integer that will contain the result of the quicksort ordering
  * _occurrences_: it's a data structure that should contain an ordered collection of pairs of integers (value, occurrences)
* testing the code is more than welcome
